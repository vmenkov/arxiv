<h1>My.ArXiv overview</h1>

<p>This document is intended to give a high-level view of My.ArXiv,
along with some essential details, to people who may be involved in its
maintenance, or may be adding new features to it.

<h2>My.Arxiv's Functionality</h2>

<p>My.ArXiv is a web application that serves as an extension
of <a href="arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>, a Cornell-University-run digital
library that, as of early 2015, contains over one million of
user-submitted scientific articles. My.ArXiv's main role is to provide
several types of personalized recommendations to users; there are
certain other personalization features as well.

<p>In order to do it, My.ArXiv relies on ArXiv.org's article database,
which is largely replicated on the My.ArXiv server. My.ArXiv has its
own user base (which, alas, is not integrated with ArXiv's own user
registration system); information about each user's history of
interaction with the system is stored, and is used to generate
personalization recommendation both for the user himself, and,
possibly, for other My.ArXiv users.

<p>Below is the list of principal functions of My.ArXiv. Some of these
functions are carried out by My.ArXiv's web application, and others,
by a set of auxiliary command-line run applications (which are
actually run by cron, typically on daily basis).

<ul>
<li>Maintaining an article database, which largely duplicates the
article data stored in ArXiv.org itself. Most of the article data are
stored in our Lucene data store; there is also the <tt>Article</tt>
table in the MySQL database, for easier linkage with user activity and
user recommendation data.

<li>Managing users. User data are stored in the MySQL database. The
My.ArXiv web application includes tools for self-service user
registration and user profile editing, as well as user administration
tool.  Each registered user selects his "subject categories of
interest", which are used for recommendation generation. 

<li>Invitation management. Presently (early 2015), users can register
at My.ArXiv by invitation only; an invitation code can be sent by
mail, or becomes available to a user after he uses the Session-Based
recommender for a while.  Each invitation code is associated with a
particular experiment plan. The invitation management tool is used to
create, open or close invitations.

<li>Generating and displaying web pages of several types:
<ul>
<li>Displaying ArXiv.org pages. An important part of My.ArXiv
operations is displaying web pages taken from the ArXiv.org main site,
and slightly personalized for our needs. Virtually all pages from
ArXiv.org can be displayed to the user by My.ArXiv, via its
FilterServlet tool. FilterServer modifies the pages, rewriting the
links to other ArXiv.org pages so that they will now point to the
respective My.ArXiv FilterServlet pages; thus the user will continue
browsing arxiv.org pages thru My.ArXiv. This allows us to record the
user's activity; in addition, FilterServlet inserts rating buttons
into some pages (article lists, article detail pages), which allow the
user to send us explicit feedback on articles, or to save articles to
his folder.

<li>Generating and displaying recommendation lists. This is the most
important functionality of My.ArXiv. There are several types of
recommendation lists, and they are generated in different ways. This
is discussed under <a href="#sug">Recommendations</a>.

<li>Generating various My.ArXiv-specific pages, intended to provide
user with a variety of personalized experiences. This includes, for
example:
<ul>
<li>search page (driven by My.ArXiv's own search tool, rather than the one in arxiv.org)
<li>self-service user registration and account service system
<li>user personal folder page, which is like an ArXiv bookmark list
<li>user document upload system. User-uploaded documents are used for recommendation generation in several experimental plans 

<li>Pages for various <a href="index.jsp#research">research</a> and <a href="index.jsp#admin">administration</a> tools
</ul>

</ul>

<li>Recording user activity. Much of the interaction of registered
users, and, to some extent, even of unregistered (anonymous) users is
recorded in My.ArXiv. The activity data (known as "Actions") are
stored in the <tt>Action</tt> table in the MySQL database. A large variety of user actions are recorded, including the following:
<ul>
<li>Viewing an article (abstract or PDF, etc), or merely expanding the
article information paragraph for a particular article when viewing a
list of articles.
<li>Explicitly "judging" (rating) an article as useful or not, via rating tools
that appear in some My.ArXiv pages.
<li>Paging through multi-page article lists (e.g., the recommendation list shown to each user in the site's main page)
<li>Adding an article to one's "personal folder" (similar to bookmarking)
<li>A document upload (discussed below) is also reflected in Action record
</ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name="sug">Personalized recommendations</a></h2>

<p>My.ArXiv's main function is generating personalized recommendation
lists for users. Each recommendation list consists of a number of
ArXiv articles selected based on a certain algorithm's ideas as to
what may be of interest to the user. There are two main types of
recommendations, presented in very different ways: session-based and
daily. For either type of recommendations, several algorithms are
available.

<h3>Session-based recommendations</h3>

<p>Session-based recommendations are available to anonymous (not
logged-in) and registered (logged-in) user alike. The only user
actions used to generate these recommendation are those recorded
during the current session.  (A session starts once you start
interacting with the My.ArXiv web site; it ends after 30 minutes of
inactivity). Typically, once you've viewed at least 3 pages (excluding
pages listed on your daily recommendation list, if you are a
registered user), a small Session-Based Recommender (a.k.a "Session
Buddy") pop-up window appears on your screen; it displays a short list
of articles that are deemed to be particularly relevant to your
interests, based on your activity in this session so far.

<p>There are several algorithms for finding relevant articles for the
purposes of generating the session-based recommendation list (SBRL).

<h3>Daily recommendations</h3>
