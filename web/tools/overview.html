<h1>My.ArXiv overview</h1>

<div align=center><em>Last edit: 2015-02-17</em></div>

<p>This document is intended to give a high-level view of My.ArXiv,
along with some essential details, to people who may be involved in its
maintenance, or may be adding new features to it.

<h2>My.Arxiv's Functionality overview</h2>

<p>My.ArXiv is a web application that serves as an extension
of <a href="arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>, a Cornell-University-run digital
library that, as of early 2015, contains over one million of
user-submitted scientific articles. My.ArXiv's main role is to provide
several types of personalized recommendations to users; there are
certain other personalization features as well.

<p>In order to do it, My.ArXiv relies on ArXiv.org's article database,
which is largely replicated on the My.ArXiv server. My.ArXiv has its
own user base (which, alas, is not integrated with ArXiv's own user
registration system); information about each user's history of
interaction with the system is stored, and is used to generate
personalization recommendation both for the user himself, and,
possibly, for other My.ArXiv users.

<p>Below is the list of principal functions of My.ArXiv. Some of these
functions are carried out by My.ArXiv's web application, and others,
by a set of auxiliary command-line run applications (which are
actually run by cron, typically on daily basis).

<ul>
<li>Maintaining an article database, which largely duplicates the
article data stored in ArXiv.org itself. Most of the article data are
stored in our Lucene data store; there is also the <tt>Article</tt>
table in the MySQL database, for easier linkage with user activity and
user recommendation data.

<li>Managing users. User data are stored in the MySQL database. The
My.ArXiv web application includes tools for self-service user
registration and user profile editing, as well as user administration
tool.  Each registered user selects his "subject categories of
interest", which are used for recommendation generation. 

<li>Invitation management. Presently (early 2015), users can register
at My.ArXiv by invitation only; an invitation code can be sent by
mail, or becomes available to a user after he uses the Session-Based
recommender for a while.  Each invitation code is associated with a
particular experiment plan. The invitation management tool is used to
create, open or close invitations.

<li>Generating and displaying web pages of several types:
<ul>
<li>Displaying ArXiv.org pages. An important part of My.ArXiv
operations is displaying web pages taken from the ArXiv.org main site,
and slightly personalized for our needs. Virtually all pages from
ArXiv.org can be displayed to the user by My.ArXiv, via its
FilterServlet tool. FilterServer modifies the pages, rewriting the
links to other ArXiv.org pages so that they will now point to the
respective My.ArXiv FilterServlet pages; thus the user will continue
browsing arxiv.org pages thru My.ArXiv. This allows us to record the
user's activity; in addition, FilterServlet inserts rating buttons
into some pages (article lists, article detail pages), which allow the
user to send us explicit feedback on articles, or to save articles to
his folder.

<li>Generating and displaying recommendation lists. This is the most
important functionality of My.ArXiv. There are several types of
recommendation lists, and they are generated in different ways. This
is discussed under <a href="#sug">Recommendations</a>.

<li>Generating various My.ArXiv-specific pages, intended to provide
user with a variety of personalized experiences. This includes, for
example:
<ul>
<li>search page (driven by My.ArXiv's own search tool, rather than the one in arxiv.org)
<li>self-service user registration and account service system
<li>user personal folder page, which is like an ArXiv bookmark list
<li>user document upload system. User-uploaded documents are used for recommendation generation in several experimental plans 

<li>Pages for various <a href="index.jsp#research">research</a> and <a href="index.jsp#admin">administration</a> tools
</ul>

</ul>

<li>Recording user activity. Much of the interaction of registered
users, and, to some extent, even of unregistered (anonymous) users is
recorded in My.ArXiv. The activity data (known as "Actions") are
stored in the <tt>Action</tt> table in the MySQL database. A large variety of user actions are recorded, including the following:
<ul>
<li>Viewing an article (abstract or PDF, etc), or merely expanding the
article information paragraph for a particular article when viewing a
list of articles.
<li>Explicitly "judging" (rating) an article as useful or not, via rating tools
that appear in some My.ArXiv pages.
<li>Paging through multi-page article lists (e.g., the recommendation list shown to each user in the site's main page)
<li>Adding an article to one's "personal folder" (similar to bookmarking)
<li>A document upload (discussed below) is also reflected in Action record
</ul>

</ul>

<h2><a name="sug">Personalized recommendations</a></h2>

<p>My.ArXiv's main function is generating personalized recommendation
lists for users. Each recommendation list consists of a number of
ArXiv articles selected based on a certain algorithm's ideas as to
what may be of interest to the user. There are two main types of
recommendations, presented in very different ways: session-based and
daily. For either type of recommendations, several algorithms are
available.

<h3>Session-based recommendations</h3>

<p>Session-based recommendations are available to anonymous (not
logged-in) and registered (logged-in) user alike. The only user
actions used to generate these recommendation are those recorded
during the current session.  (A session starts once you start
interacting with the My.ArXiv web site; it ends after 30 minutes of
inactivity). Typically, once you've viewed at least 3 pages (excluding
pages listed on your daily recommendation list, if you are a
registered user), a small Session-Based Recommender (a.k.a "Session
Buddy") pop-up window appears on your screen; it displays a short list
of articles that are deemed to be particularly relevant to your
interests, based on your activity in this session so far.

<p>There are several algorithms for finding relevant articles for the
purposes of generating the session-based recommendation list (SBRL).

<p>See a table of SBR methods <a href="index.jsp#sb">here</a>.

<h3>Daily recommendations</h3>

<p>More expansive recommendations are produced nightly by several
recommendation engines that run every night, after new articles have
been imported into My.ArXiv. A recommendation list is produced for
each registered users, making use of all available information about
the user's activity.

<p>Each My.ArXiv user is enrolled into one of My.ArXiv's several
"experiment plans" (aka "programs"); each experiment plan has its
particular method for generating recommendation lists. Supported
experiment plans, as defined in the enum type User.Program, include the following:
<ul>
<li>SET_BASED, Thorsten Joachim's original recommender based on the user's previous activity and document content
<li>PPP, Thorsten's Perturbed Perceptron (3PR)
<li>EE3, Peter Frazier's Exploration - Exploitation ver. 3
<li>EE4, Peter Frazier's Exploration - Exploitation ver. 4
<li>EE5, Peter Frazier's Exploration - Exploitation ver. 5.
</ul>

<p>
The SET_BASED and PPP methods maintain a user profile vector for each
user, based on the content of the documents the user has interacted
with in a "positive" and "negative" ways. Article recommendations are
made based on a match between the user profile and the content of
the recommended articles.

<p>
The EE methods divide each article category into several subsets
(clusters); different clustering techniques are used in EE4 and
EE5. (The one for EE5 is implemented by Xiaoting Zhao's code, and is
not part of My.ArXiv's own codebase). 

<h2>My.ArXiv Components</h2>

<p>In this section, we briefly review the data stored, modified, and used by My.ArXiv.

<h3>Lucene Datastore</h3>

<p>The Lucene data store, residing under
/data/arxiv/arXiv-index/ , is used to store the full text and metadata of all ArXiv articles. It is accessed via the Lucene Java API.

<p>The data store is updated nightly by a cron-driven command-line
application, <a href="#ArxivImporter">ArxivImporter</a>, which gets
the list of recently uploaded or updated articles from Arxiv's OAI2
web interface, and the article bodies, from the files (in /data/txt/ )
that are loaded daily to our server daily by Paul Ginsparg rsync
application.

<p>The document information in the data store is accessed both by the
My.ArXiv web application and by various cron-driven command line applications.

<p>The design of My.ArXiv's Lucene data store was influenced by the
design of the data store that was previously used by Throsten
Joachim's team in their project on osmot and kodiak. However, over the
years out design has been significantly changed, to accommodate the needs of various My.ArXiv components.

<p>The Java source code working with the Lucene data store is found primarily 
in the package <a href="../doc/html/api/edu/rutgers/axs/indexer/package-summary.html">edu.rutgers.axs.indexer</a>.

<h3>MySQL database</h3>

<p>
The MySQL database stores the greatest variety of information among
all My.ArXiv's data sources. In particular, it contains information
about My.ArXiv users and their interaction with the system (both what
the user did [e.g. the Action table or the Query table] and what the
system presented to the user [e.g. the PresentedList table]).

<p>In production, the data in the MySQL database are primarily
accessed via
the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html">javax.persistence</a>
interface, as supported by OpenJPA. Occasionally, <emad hoc</em> SQL
queries and updates can be fed to the server directly with the command
line interface (script mysql.sh)

<p>Following the javax.persistence / OpenJPA paradigm, we have one Java class 
(in the package <a href="../doc/html/api/edu/rutgers/axs/sql/package-summary.html">edu.rutgers.axs.sql</a>) mapped to one table in the MySQL database.

<p>
For a brief overview of the tables contained in the MySQL database, and the JPQL or SQL that can be used to access them (in particular, via our <a href="queryForm.jsp">interactive tool</a>), see the <a href="manual.html">My.arXiv database query guide</a>

<h3>My.ArXiv disk files</h3>

<p>Besides storing document information in the Lucene data store, and
various transactional data in the MySQL database, we also store
certain information in disk files. These files, located under
/data/arxiv/arXiv-data/ , serve several purposes:
<ul>
<li>User-specific files, in directory /data/arxiv/arXiv-data/user. This directory has
one subdirectory for each user. The main class controlling writing these files and access
to them is 
<ul>
<li>User-uploaded documents (the "Toronto system"), in subdirectories upload_pdf and upload_txt.
<li>User profile files and "suggestion lists" (lists of recommended articles) for whatever experimental plan the user is enrolled in. The subdirectory names are based on the specific functionality.
</ul>
<li>Non-user specific files containing data for a particular recommendation engine. Presenntly, we only have these kind of data for EE4 (document clustering computed by My.ArXiv's own application, <a href="/doc/html/api/edu/rutgers/axs/ee4/KMeans.html">KMeans</a>), and EE5 (the data obtained from Xiaoting).
</ul>

<h3>Coaccess matrices</h3>

<p>Outside of the realm of My.ArXiv proper, but indirectly used by it, are the data files of the <a href="#coaccess">Coaccess Server</a>.

<h3>Data from arxiv.org</h3>

<p>A variety of data is regularly uploaded to the My.ArXiv server from the main arxiv.org servcer, using tools such as rsync. The My.ArXiv web application does not directly access those files, but some of them are directly or indirectly used by My.ArXiv's associated command-line applications. This includes:

<ul>
<li>Article bodies,  in /data/txt, used by the <a href="#ArxivImporter">ArxivImporter</a>.

<li>Usage data (user-article interactions). These are used e.g. to build the coaccess matrix for the <a href="#coaccess">Coaccess Server</a>. These are also used by the (not-so-successful) history clustering tool (<a href="/doc/html/api/edu/rutgers/axs/ee4/HistoryClustering.html">HistoryClustering</a>) in EE4.

<li>A variety of data is used by certain other research applications; we have a number of shell scripts in My.ArXiv's main directory that extracts and formats the data in various ways.
</ul>

<h2>My.Arxiv command-line applications</h2>

<p>Many of the applications listed in this section run every night, initiated by cron.

<h3><a name="ArxivImporter">ArxivImporter</a></h3>

<p>An essential tool, ArxivImporter starts the nightly series of cron
jobs.  It updates the Lucene data store, making use of the list of
recently uploaded or updated articles from Arxiv's OAI2 web interface,
and the article bodies, from the files (in /data/txt/ ) that are
loaded daily to our server daily by Paul Ginsparg rsync application.

<p>This tool's main class is 
<a href="../doc/html/api/edu/rutgers/axs/indexer/ArxivImporter.html">ArxivImporter</a>. 

<h2><a name="coaccess">Coaccess Server</a></h2>

<p>The Coaccess Server is not, strictly speaking, part of My.ArXiv. It is a separate web application (<a href="http://my.arxiv.org/coaccess/">http://my.arxiv.org/coaccess/</a>); however, it has been created primarily for My.ArXiv's needs.
