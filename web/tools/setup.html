<h1>My.arXiv: notes on setting up one's development environment</h1>

<p>This document is based on notes written in February 2013 for a new developer.

<h2>Where to develop?</h2>

<p>
Since you need to do actual work on the system, our first
order of business may be to decide what environment you set up, and
where. Presently, the organization is as follows.
There is the "production" server, such as there is, on
cactuar.rutgers.edu ; it runs the application that you see at
http://my.arxiv.org/arxiv  . For a number of reasons, that server is
not particularly suitable for development work, although I do use it
sometimes as a test environment (sharing the same database with the
production environment, though!). I have a complete development
environment (web server, MySQL database, Lucene data store, etc) on my
Rutgers-issued laptop, and do the entire development cycle there,
until pushing an updated version of the application to cactuar.

<p>So there are at least two options for you at the moment. If you have a
decent desktop computer, with, say 100 - 150 GB of space to spare,
fast internet connection, access to an SMTP server (to actually send
email) and a week of time, you could set up a complete operational
MyArXiv site of your own, with your own MySQL database, Lucene data
store and everything else. I'll provide instructions. (If disk space
is a concern, we may build it with a smaller article library, or
something.) This way you could do all development on that platform,
and not be concerned with any cactuar issues at all, at least not
until the moment of finally adding your code into the production
server. While it obviously will take quite a bit of time and effort to
get started this way, a side effect of this procedure will be that
you'll train yourself to be the Cornell's expert on setting and
maintaining the site in the future. (Thorsten may have told you about
his plans to buy quite a bit of new hardware for the project, to run
at Cornell).

<p>
An easier option may be for you to just do editing and compiling of
your code on a computer of your own at Cornell, and then moving it to
cactuar to do the actual testing. For this, you only will need to have
various Java tools (JDK, Apache Ant) and libraries (Open JPA and
others; you can just copy them from cactuar) on your host.  Of course,
running things on cactuar is non-trivial (e.g. you cannot just deploy
your web application and have it run right away: you'll have to wait
for up to an hour!). But there are ways to get things done. In
particular, Thorsten's specs for the email notification tool seem to
make it possible to implement it as a separate command-line
application (which, eventually, will be run nightly from cron),
instead of trying to incorporate it into the web server. So testing on
cactuar probably will be doable.

<h2>Setup - first stage</h2>
<p>
Now that you have a cactuar account, you should be able to ssh to it,
and take a look at the files in the directory
/mnt/cactext/home/SCILSNET/vmenkov/arxiv

<p>
On your "development machine" (whatever computer at Rutgers you end up
using to edit and compile your java code) you'll need to reproduce
(partially) that structure. Let's begin with these several things
(below, I assume that you use Linux/Unix on your development machine;
if not, you'll have to perform similar operations in the OS you use):

<pre>
1)  start with your home directory, and create there the arxiv subdir:
   cd ~
   mkdir arxiv
   cd arxiv

2)  create a library dir

   mkdir lib

3) Copy all *.jar files from
/mnt/cactext/home/SCILSNET/vmenkov/arxiv/lib  to the "lib" directory
you've just created.

3a) A few jar files for ant:
cd ~
mkdir .ant
cd .ant
mkdir lib
ln -s ~/arxiv/tomcat-lib/catalina-ant.jar .
ln -s /usr/local/apache-openjpa-2.1.1/openjpa-all-2.1.1.jar .

4) See if you have access to the source code at the Cornell
SourceForge repository:
   https://forge.cornell.edu/sf/projects/my_arxiv_org
I believe you do.

5) Get the current version of the MyArXiv source code from the Cornell
SourceForge repository:

    cd ~/arxiv
    svn co https://forge.cornell.edu/svn/repos/arxiv

This will create subdirectory "arxiv" under ~/arxiv  (i.e.,
~/arxiv/arxiv),  and will copy all the source tree into it.

6) Check if you have Apache ant on your development machine. If not, install it.

7) Try to compile the application
   cd ~/arxiv/arxiv
   ant jar

(The "ant" command   will use the build file build.xml, which comes
together with the source code distribution).

8) Try to explicitly create the directory
/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/arxiv   (I assume that your tomcat lives in
/usr/local/tomcat ), and making to readable and writeable to yourself.

9) Deploy the application to tomcat
   ant deploy

</pre>
<p>

Once you have the code and can compile it, we can start talking about
how you can do development and testing.

<h2>Trying to run an application</h2>
<p>
Now that you have been able to fully compile the MyArXiv code on your
machine (i.e., you have axs.jar generated), we can try to go to the
next stage: actually running some MyArXiv application. There are
basically two types of MyArXiv applications: there is the web
application (the code that serves our web site,
http://my.arxiv.org/arxiv )

<p>
To run the former, you deploy the application to your Tomcat server's
webapps/arxiv directory, using the command
<pre>
   ant deploy
</pre>
After this, you could access the application  via   http://localhost:8080/arxiv
(this assumes that your Tomcat is configured to use port 8080)

<p>
The latter (the command line scripts) are represented by  a number of
shell scripts (*.sh) that you have in    ~/arxiv/arxiv ,  which have
come with the MyArXiv source code from the Cornell Source Forge.
Theoretically speaking, you can now run any of them from the command
line. For example
   ./cmd.sh showcoef cs/0605035
will show the indexed body of the specified article.

<p>
Of course, neither of this will actually work in any sensible way at
the moment, because both the web application and the command-line
tools rely on 3 external resources:

<ol>
<li>The Lucene data store: a few really big local files that contain
the metadata and text of some 800,000 ArXiv articles. As I understand,
 the email notification application you are going to design won't need
these data for its core logic, but it will need to  get some data from
the Lucene data store (such as the article titles etc) when generating
the actual email messages.

<li> The database in the MySQL server. It stores most of the
"operational" information about users, their activity, and our plans
for them. Your application will access it heavily.

<li> Local data files, stored in ~vmenkv/arxiv/arXiv-data on cactuar.
MyArXiv's recommendation engines store user profiles, suggestion
lists, etc. there. I sort of hope your application can do without
them, getting sufficient information just from the SQL database; but
this is yet to be seen.

<p>
It seems at the moment that the most useful thing for us would be
enabling remote access from your machine to the MySQL server at
cactuar. However, this is not allowed for security reasons.

<p>
Regarding the Lucene data store. If you happen to have plenty of disk
space available on your machine (as in, "17 GB is no big deal"), and
really good internet bandwidth, you may choose to copy the entire
directory ~vmenkov/arxiv/arXiv-index from cactuar to the corresponding
location on your machine. Otherwise, you can run the ArxivImporter
utility to create a smaller dataset (say, a few weeks' most recent
articles) on your machine; however, you can't do it right now yet,
because ArxivImporter needs to talk to the SQL server.
