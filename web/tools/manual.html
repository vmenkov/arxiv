<h1>My.arXiv database query guide</h1>

<p>This document discusses the data stored in My.ArXiv's database, and ways of accessing them with JPQL and SQL queries, using the <a href="queryForm.jsp">JPQL and SQL query form</a>.

<h2>Data description</h2>

<p>The  <a href="queryForm.jsp">query form</a> allows you to send a free-form <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E11035_01/kodo41/full/html/ejb3_overview_query.html">JPQL</a> or SQL query to our database. 
</p>


<h2>JPQL vs. SQL</h2>

<p>JPQL can be thought as a sort of "object-oriented" wrapper over
SQL. As far as our application is concerned, the main difference
between the two is the following: when object of one type contains a
reference to an object of another type (e.g., a PhoneCall refers to
the Respondent being called), SQL "talks" in terms of the actual
stored table column (here, respondent_id), while JPQL "talks" in terms
of objects being references.<p>


<p>Hint: you can use the first 3 JPQL queries from the table below to see what the names of all fields in each table are.</p>

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>JPQL <th>SQL <th>comments
<tr><th colspan=3>The <tt>arxiv_users</tt> table (<tt>User</tt> entries)</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=3>Each <tt>User</tt> object describes one registered My.ArXiv user. The information about a user is stored in a row of the <tt>arxiv_users</tt> table. (Usually, the names of SQL tables are the same as those of OpenJPA objects, so that you can use the same name in SQL and JPQL queries. However, in this case, due to historical reasons, the two names are different.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>select x from User x <td> select x.* from arxiv_users x
<td>Show all User entries.

<tr><th colspan=3>The <tt>Action</tt> table (<tt>Action</tt> entries)</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=3>Each <tt>Action</tt> entry contains information about one recordable user action. Each action is performed by a particular user, and has a particular ArXiv article as its object. Action types include adding an article to the user's folder (sort of a bookmark list), or removing it from the folder; viewing the article's abstract page or PDF page; explicitly rating an article as "new and useful", "useless", etc; marking the article as "not to be shown to me again"; etc. Each action contains the id of the PresentedList object (see below), which is understood as its contex.t

<br>For each action we record the "action source", which contains information about the "context" in which the action was effected.

Link user actions with presented lists. This shows for each user action (a) the context ("presented list") in which it was effected. This selection does <em>not</em> user actions that did not originate in the "suggestion list" or "search" constants, as those other context (e.g., FOLDER or FILTER) don't have "presented lists" as such.
