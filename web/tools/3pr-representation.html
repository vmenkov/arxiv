<h1>Document and user profile representation for 3PR: original version</h1>

<p align=center><em>Updated: 2013-12-24</em></p>

<p>This is an overview of the document representation and related
calculations currently used for the 3PR scheme. This approach
originates from the approach that was used for the SET_BASED scheme
since the late 2011, but is much simpler, since the utility function
used with 3PR has no non-linear part.

<p><strong>Notation:</strong>
<br>F : field (F='title', 'abstract', 'authors', 'article')
<br>d : document (represented as ArXiv document aid)
<br>t : term (word), e.g. 'rabbit'

<p>
<strong>Raw term frequency</strong> (an integer value):
<br>
f(t,F,d) = the number of occurrences of term t in field F of document d

<p>
<strong>Field boost</strong>, boost(F,d) : a value associated with the
field F of document d. The field boosts have been computed
individually for all fields of each document according to a certain
heuristic, intended to give higher values to more important but short
fields (such as titles). They vary both between fields and between
documents. For example if article d1 has 1000 authors (some papers
from CERN do!), and d2 has 2 authors, then
<center>
	 boost('authors',d1) <	 boost('authors',d2).
</center>

<p>
<strong>IDF</strong> 
<center>
idf(t) =  1+ log(numdocs* nf / (1 + totalDF(t))), 
</center>
where 
<br>
&nbsp;  numdocs = size of the collection (around 900,000),
<br>  
&nbsp;   nf = 4 = number of fields
<br>
&nbsp;   totaldDF(t) = the number of pair {d,F} where term t is found in field F of document d. (Thus,  0 < totalDF(t) <= numdocs* nf ).
<br>
(This is a somewhat unorthodox adaptation of the traditional IDF concept;
this particular design was motivated mainly by the efficiency of operation
on our index).

<p>
A <strong>"flattened document"</strong> is a linear combination of a document's
field. It's represented as a vector <strong>c</strong>(d) in term space, with elements
<center>
c(t,d) = &Sigma;<sub>F</sub> (   f(t,F,d) * boost(F,d) )
</center>

<p>Conceptually, all computations are based on sqrt(idf)-weighted and normalized document vectors 
<strong>ĉ</strong>(d)/norm(d), where
<center>
ĉ(t,d) = c(t,d) * sqrt(idf(t)) =
&Sigma;<sub>F</sub> (   f(t,F,d) * boost(F,d) ) * sqrt(idf(t))
</center>
and the <strong>document norm</strong> norm(d) is a Euclidean norm of <strong>ĉ</strong>(d) (i.e., the norm of the document vector in idf-weighted space):
<center>
norm(d) = |<strong>ĉ</strong>(d)| = sqrt( &Sigma;<sub>t</sub>  ( c(t,d)<sup>2</sup> * idf(t) ) )
</center>

<p>
The  <strong>user profile</strong>, <strong>w&#x0302;</strong>, is computed as a linear combination of normalized documents (a bit like a Rocchio classifier):
<center>
<strong>w&#x0302;</strong> = &Sigma;<sub>{d in D}</sub> ( &rho;(d) * <strong>ĉ</strong>(d) / norm(d))
</center>
i.e.
<center>
w&#x0302;(t) = &Sigma;<sub>{d in D}</sub>( &rho;(d) * &Sigma;<sub>F</sub> f(t,F,d) * boost(t,d) *  sqrt(idf(t)) / norm(d))
</center>

<p>
Here, D is the set of documents on which we have explicit or implicit user feedback. &rho;(d) is the coefficient controlling the total contribution
of document d to the user profile <strong>w&#x0302;</strong>. It
comes from the daily updates, as set forth in 3PR
specifications. E.g., if a day's feedback involves comparative value
for the user of the documents in the <em>j</em>-th and
(<em>j</em>+1)-th positions on the suggestion list, then this day's
update's contributions to the &rho;(d) for the two documents involved
are &pm;(&gamma;(j) - &gamma;(j+1)).

<p>
For computation purposes, we  factor w&#x0302;(t) as
<center>
w&#x0302;(t) = w(t) * sqrt(idf(t)),
</center>
and actually compute and store <strong>w</strong> rather
than <strong>w&#x0302;</strong>.

<p><strong>Ranking documents.</strong> Since the utility function used
in 3PR is linear, the problem of finding the optimal
ordering <em>y</em> for a given user profile
vector <strong>w&#x0302;</strong> is reduced to that of ranking
normalized document vectors <strong>ĉ</strong>(d)/norm(d) with respect
to their dot product with  <strong>w&#x0302;</strong>. 
The score of the document d is
<center>
Score(d,w) = ( <strong>ĉ</strong>(d)  / norm(d)) <strong>&#x00B7; w&#x0302;</strong> =
   &Sigma;<sub>t</sub>  ( c(t,d) * w(t,d) * idf(t) ) / norm(d)
</center>


<h3>Notes on the practical implementation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Raw frequencies are stored in the Lucene data store
<li>totalDF(t) is easily obtained from Lucene (this is why we have the peculiar formula for IDF)
<li>c(t,d) is computed on-demand by ArticleAnalyzer.getCoef(), by summing the numbers for individual fields retrived from the Lucene data store
<li>The boost values, and document norms are usually computed just once (when a document is first added to the collection), and are stored in the MySQL database for later use. This technique is not strictly correct, since it does not take into account a gradual change of idf values as more documents are added to the collection.
</ul>

We don't actually compute sqrt(idf). Instead:
<ul>
<li>For the user profile, we store not <strong>w&#x0302;</strong>, but
a similar vector <strong>w</strong> which does not have sqrt(idf) factored in;
<li>When documents are scored for the creation of the new suggestion
list, components of c(t,d)/norm(d) are obtained (using the raw freqency values
from the Lucene data store, and the boost and norm values from the
MySQL database), and then the sum
<center>
Score(d,w) =   &Sigma;<sub>t</sub>  ( (c(t,d)/norm(d)) * w(t,d) * idf(t) )
</center>
is computed.
</ul>

<p>In reality, the document-ranking code and the user-profile-updating
still maintains all the complicated parts for dealing with the
non-linear scores, and the "non-linear" components of the user profile
vector and document representation vector, as those were outlined in
the original SET_BASED paper in 2011. However, all those non-linear
components are kept as zeros, and thus don't affect anything.
