Generating MyArxiv's JSP pages.

<p>
Most classes here correspond to one JSP page in MyArXiv's web
directory. At the top of the JSP page we have a constructor for an
object of the corresponding class, in which all the necessary
actions needed for this JSP page are carried, and which computed all
the values needed to display the resulting page. In the rest of the
JSP pages, various values in that object are accessed and rendered.
