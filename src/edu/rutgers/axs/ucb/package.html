UCB - Upper confidence bound algorithm.<p>

This package contains most of the code of the daily update application (the stuff that interacts with the SQL server, Lucene data store, and user profile files). Chen Bangrui's UCB math code, which can be compiled independently, is in a separate package ( edu.rutgers.axs.ucb.math).<p>
