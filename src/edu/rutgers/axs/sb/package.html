Session-Based Recommendation List generator. It is used from {@link edu.rutgers.axs.web.SessionBased}.

<h2>Notes on Session-Based Recommendation List generation</h2>

<p>This section summarizes the data flow currently (May 2014) involved in the
generation of the Session-Based Eecommendation Lists (SBRL), and gives the overview of the relevant parts of the web application architecture.

<h3>Session information</h3>

<p>The My.ArXiv web application conducts its session management using
the standard session management support provided by the Sun's (now
Oracle's) Servlet API (see
interface <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html">javax.servlet.http.HttpSession</a>)
and the Apache Tomcat server.  This is mostly done beyons the scenes,
but in practice Apache Tomcat manages sessions using cookies (which we
do not access explicitly). A "session", thus is a group of user's
requests which the server knows to have come from the same web browser
instance on the same host within a certain short period of time (say,
30 min), as identified by the cookies exchanged by the server and the
browser.

<p>
In the My.ArXiv's architecture, most of non-trivial actions needed to
generate any JSP page is carried out by a specific class that extends
{@link edu.rutgers.axs.web.ResultsBase}; specifically, it is the
constructor of the relevant class that is invoked. In particular, the
JSP page that produces the Session-Based Recommendation List panel
(AKA the "Session Buddy") relies for its data on the class {@link
edu.rutgers.axs.web.SessionBased}. As all classes extending {@link
edu.rutgers.axs.web.ResultsBase}, {@link
edu.rutgers.axs.web.SessionBased} is capable of directly accessing the
structire ResultsBase.sd, which is an instance of {@link
edu.rutgers.axs.web.SessionData}. This instance is associated with the
current session, and allows one to access necessary information about
the previous user activity in this session; it also allows one to
store certain data to simplify the recomputation of the SBRL 

<H3>The link between SessionData and the SBRL generation </h3>

<p>In each SessionData instance there is an instance of {@link
edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGenerator} (field SessionData.sbrg), which
contains parameters and objects related to SBRL generation.

<H3>The organization of the SBRL generation process</h3>

<p>Presently, three classes are responsible for the SBRL generation:
{@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGenerator},
{@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGThread}, and
{@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGWorker} (and its child classes).
The second class, {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGThread}, extends the Java Thread class, and serves as a wrapper for the SBRGWorker. It is {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGWorker} of an appropriate type which implements the actual computations
involved in the creating of a SBRL; its work() method is
the main method for this computation resides. The
first class, {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGenerator}, provides the
necessary scheduling framework for these computations. It ensures:
<ul>
<li> that all requests to update the SBRL (after one more page has been viewed,
etc) are taken into account; 
<li> that no more than one instance of the actual computation process (the method run() in {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGThread}) is active at any time;
<li>  that the most recently computed SBRL is available for retrieval.
</ul>

<p>Each {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGWorker} instance also stores
certain data that can be reused whenever recomputing the SBRL during
the session. E.g., in our main algorithm presently - computing an
"article-based suggestion list" for each viewed article, and then
merging it into the current SBRL- all already computed article-based
suggestion lists are stored here for quick reuse.

<h3>How the web browser requests the Session-Based Recommendation List</h3>

<p>The SBRL pop-up window in the web browser contains the web page
sessionBased.jsp. To see what happens on the server when this web page is requested, look into the JSP code; you can see that most of the action happens in 
the constructor of the class  {@link edu.rutgers.axs.web.SessionBased}. 

<p>The SessionBased class constructor invokes  {@link
edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGenerator#getSR()}:
<pre> 
	    sr = sd.sbrg.getSR();
</pre>
This method {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGenerator#getSR()} checks if the 
session-based recommendation list for this session has already been generated, 
and if it is, returns it.

<p>The web page sessionBased.jsp also has arrangments for waitig for a
few seconds and automatic self-reloading if the SBRL was not available
the first time around.


<h3>SBRGWorker subclasses</h3>

<p>Presently, most SBRL generation methods use class SBRGWorker itself. A subclass, SBRGWorkerMerge, is used to implement a composite worker, which causes to "underlying" workers create their respective rec lists, and then merges the two using the team-draft process.

<p>More subclasses can be added to implement other methods.

<h3>Expansion support</h3>

<p>How can we easily add new SBRL generation algorithms to the
existing framework? The easiest approach is to subclass SBRGWorker as needed,
overriding the method work() or some methods it calls. The method
SBRGenerator.createWorker(), should be modify appropriately, to ensure that a
worker object of the appropriate type is created for a particular combination
of parameters.

<h3>Test harness</h3>

<p>There is a command line tool which can be used to test various SBR generation methods without running an actual web session. See {@link edu.rutgers.axs.sb.SBRGeneratorCmdLine} for details.
