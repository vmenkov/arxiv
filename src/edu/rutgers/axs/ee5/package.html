Peter Frazier and Xiaoting Zhao's Exploration Engine ver 5 (EE5).

<h2>Algorithmiscs</h2>

<p>The algorithms involved are outlined in documents prepared by Peter
Frazier and Xiaoting Zhao: EE5_documentation.pdf
newCluster_documentation.pdf Oct7_2014_notes.pdf practical_paper.pdf
submission_draft.pdf

<h2>Persistent data structures</h2>

<p>There are several EE5-related tables in the database (typically,
each one corresponding to the eponymous class
in <a href="../sql/">edu.rutgers.axs.sql</a>). These are the relevant JPA classes:

<ul>
<li>EE5DocClass : basic information about the document clusters in the
current document clustering scheme. Each entry in this table links the
cluster's (global) ID with the pair (cateegory_name, local_id), where
local_id is the sequential number (0-based) of the cluster within the
list of clusters for the category.

<li>EE5User : there is one entry in this table for each user (and, thus a User object) entolled in the EE5 program. It is used to link the user with the set of his EE5Uci objects.

<li>EE5Uci : each EE5Uci objects describes the "user-cluster affinity"
for a particular user and a particular document cluster. The stored
values are the alpha and beta for this (user, doc_cluster)
pair. Presently, there is actually no particular need to persist these
values, since they all are re-computed during the daily update (when
each user's entire history is reviewed) and used later during the same
update session.

</ul>

<p>Besides the above tables, an important piece of EE5-related information is found in 
the table Article. In each Article object we have two fields:
<ul>
<li><tt>Article.ee5classId</tt>, which stores the (global) cluster ID, as of the most recent clustering scheme;
<li><tt>Article.ee5missingBody</tt>: a boolean field which is set to true if <tt>Article.ee5classId</tt> was set based on the article's metadata only, without the article's body being available.
</ul>

<h2>Overview of operations</h2>

<h3>Delete All</h3>


<P>The "Delete All" operation is to be carried out every time word
clustering (word2vec) and document clustering has been re-run by
Xiaoting's application, and a new clustering scheme (the set of
P-vectors for each categoy) is installed.

<p>The deletion is done to ensure that the data associated with the
previous clustering scheme won't interfere with newly generated data.
</p>

<p>These operations delete from the MySQL database the
information associated with the current clustering scheme.  In
particular, all data from the table EE5DocClass are erased; the as the
EE5-related fields of the Article table are reset.  Although the old
EE5Uci data become irrelevant on the installation of a new clustering scheme,
we don't delete them here, since they will be replaced on the next Update run anyway.

<pre>
./ee5-daily.sh delete
</pre>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<P>Preceded by the "Delete All" operations, the Initialization is to
be carried out every time word clustering (word2vec) and document
clustering has been re-run by Xiaoting's application, perhaps once
every few months.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doc cluster initialization: fill the table EE5DocClass. (This is just a formality: we set cluster ID and alpha0, beta0).
  <li>Read the article-to-doc-cluster assignment, if it has been supplied.
    <ul>
      <li>Article.setEe5classId() for each document.
    </ul>
  <li>In the absence of pre-computed cluster assignment data, our
    application itself will assign documents to clusters. In
    principle, we can re-run cluster assignment on all 1,000,000+
    documents in My.ArXiv. In practice, though, we never use cluster
    assignment information for ArXiv articles that are so old that
    they have never been shown to any EE5 users (or to EE4 users that
    have later been converted to EE5). Thus, only processing articles
    that have been submitted since 2013-01-01 is probably quite sufficient.
    <ul>
      <li>Article.setEe5classId(...) 
      <li>Article.setMissingBody(...) 
    </ul>
</ul>

<pre>
./ee5-daily.sh init
</pre

<h3>On a daily run</h3>

<pre>
./ee5-daily.sh update
</pre

<p>
The main application is <tt>edu.rutgers.axs.ee5.Daily</tt>

<p>The update process should run every night, as soon as ArxivImporter
finishes. It will assign new articles to clusters, update per-cluster
statistics, and generate new suggestion lists for all users in the EE5
experiment plan.

<ul>
  <li>Update article submission statistics per cluster (EE5DocClass.setL()) 

  <li>Read the P vectors (doc-cluster to vector in vector cluser space);
    (1,000 clusters *(L=1024)) = 10^6 values.  Keep in an in-memory structure.

  <li>Read the word (multigram) to cluster assignment map (Z).   Keep in an in-memory structure. (perhaps 10^6 words, each one mapped to one word cluster). The list of keys of this map provides the master (multigram) vocabulary.

  <li>Identify all docs without cluster assignment (new docs), as we do in EE4. (<tt>Daily.updateClassInfo()</tt>)

  <li>For each such document:
    <ul>
      <li>Convert the document (sequence of words) to a sequence of multigrams, 
	based on the master vocabulary. The greedy rule (always pick the longest
	word), illustrated in Alex Alemi's script (parse_vocab.py) will be used.
      <li>Treating the so processed document as a "bag of multigrams",
	represent it as a vector in multigram space. 
      <li>Convert doc to a vector in word vector space, using Z
      <li>Find the nearest doc cluster index (as per the maximization rule in  newCluster_documentation.pdf)
      <li>Article.setEe5classId()
    </ul>
      
  <li>For each user in experiment plan EE5:  Daily.makeEE5Sug()
    <ul>
      <li> updateUserVote(): like in EE4    
      <li> updateSugList(): use the c(alpha, beta,...) matrices from Xiaoting
    </ul>

</ul>
